The solution involves restructuring the CSS code to ensure the intended styling is applied. One approach is to use a more specific selector to explicitly target the element that needs a specific style. In this case, to avoid the overriding, you might use the more specific selectors or adjust the order of CSS rules.  This emphasizes the importance of clear and structured CSS in managing specificity and avoid unforeseen style overrides. 

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class div {
  color: red;
}

#specific-id {
  color: green; /*This ensures the highest specificity*/
}

div#specific-id {
  color: purple; /* this will override as it is more specific*/
}
```
